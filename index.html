<li><p>To hold a rules summit, a quorum of members must be present, either in person or electronically. If a quorum is not met, the summit will be postponed until such time that more members can be in attendance.</p></li>
<li>Any and all team owners may present a proposed amendment at the rules summit. Each proposal will be discussed and voted on by the members in attendance. The present members will vote by simple majority to add the proposed amendment to a list of Constitutional changes. This list must then go before all team owners to be voted on.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>An amendment to the Constitution will only be added with a 2/3 vote of the entire league and must be voted on prior to the day of the draft.

<li><p>The league dues are set at $75 per team.</p></li>
<li><p>The league does not assess a fee for transactions of any kind, therefore a team owner will not be required to pay more than the $50 for league dues each year to continue owning their respective team.</p></li>
<li>Payment of league dues by each member is required by the start of each fantasy season. A penalty will be imposed on a team owner for not paying his or her league dues by this date.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>The assessed penalty for late payment is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Before Week 1 - no penalty</li>
<li>After Week 1 - a loss of 1 point for the negligent fantasy team in that week’s head-to-head matchup.</li>
<li>After Week 2 - a loss of 2 points for the negligent fantasy team in that week’s head-to-head matchup.</li>
<li>After Week 3 - a loss of 4 points for the negligent fantasy team in that week’s head-to-head matchup.</li>
<li>After Week 4 - a loss of 8 points for the negligent fantasy team in that week’s head-to-head matchup.</li>
<li>After Week 5 - a loss of 16 points for the negligent fantasy team in that week’s head-to-head matchup.</li>
<li>After Week 6 - dismissal from the league, only overturned by a unanimous vote of all owners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Any league member may volunteer to pay another owners league dues at any time, however he or she will take on that debt outside of the parameters of the league rules and regulations and collection of that debt will not be considered an issue pertinent to the operation of the league.</li>
<li>A dismissal from the league does not require a refund of league dues. This can only be done at the discretion of the Commissioner and subject to <a href="#league-action-and-veto-power">1.1.1.3</a>.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The Commissioner may assess a one-time fee on any member as a result of a rule violation. The terms of the fee and payment will be decided by the Commissioner and will be subject to <a href="#league-action-and-veto-power">1.1.1.3</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commissioner or any other member of the league may suggest the assessment of a onetime fee for the purposes of the improvement or the betterment of the league. These suggestions will be taken under review by the league and can only be passed by a unanimous vote. The intent of such a fee will be to increase the level of enjoyment, i.e. the purchase of a trophy for the league winner/loser, food or drinks for an event, or other discretionary expenses.</p></li>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.2</span> Exiting Owners and New Owners</h2>
<div id="mid-season-transfers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1</span> Mid-Season Transfers</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In the event that an owner leaves the league for any reason during a fantasy season, the vacated ownership slot will immediately become available to a new owner and league member.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commissioner must act in good faith with the league to find a new team owner as soon as possible in an effort to make a smooth transition and not disrupt the operations of the league.</p></li>
<li><p>A new owner will be proposed to the league by the Commissioner and all members of the league must vote to accept or deny the proposal.</p></li>
<li><p>A 2/3 vote by the league members is needed to accept a new ownership proposal. Should the proposal be accepted, the new member will assume responsibility for the team immediately. Should the proposal be denied, the team will remain without an owner and the search for a new league member will continue.</p></li>
<li>The Commissioner will be responsible for managing and maintaining any vacated team until such a time as a new permanent owner can be presented and accepted per <a href="#mid-season-transfers">2.2.1.2-4</a>. In this situation the Commissioner will be held to all rules and regulations regarding team management and maintenance, however on matters of voting he will not be granted additional voting rights for the vacated team.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Example: A team becomes vacated during the season and the Commissioner assumes operation of that team. Before a new owner can be found a situation arises that would require the voting of all team owners. The Commissioner is not allowed two separate votes based on the fact that he manages two teams. He or she will retain all original voting powers given to the Commissioner but no additional votes at any time, for any reason.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Any and all situations calling for a vote by the full league, be it a simple majority, a 2/3 vote, etc., during the period before a new owner has been chosen will be calculated using the total number of current owners, not the total number of teams in the league.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>Example: With the departure of 1 team owner from the league, majority and 2/3 will be calculated using 11 as the base number of votes. If there are 2 simultaneously vacated teams the base number of votes is reduced to 10, and so on and so forth.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>A new owner will accept the team in the condition that it was vacated in, including any additions and/or deletions made by the Commissioner in the interim period. However, once a new owner has been approved by the league, he or she has the right to make changes to their team, subject to the rules and regulations in the Constitution.</p></li>
<li><p>The league dues assessed to a new owner will be calculated using the percentage of the remainder of the fantasy season once control of the team has been granted. This payment will be due in full by the end of the fantasy season.</p></li>
<li><p>New team owner dues may be distributed to the previous team owner as a refund at the discretion of the Commissioner. In the event that the previous team owner cannot be reached or that the Commissioner decides not to reimburse the previous owner, the money will be deposited in to a discretionary fund for the league’s use.</p></li>
<li><p>Should a team become vacated and a new owner is not presented and approved before the end of the fantasy season, the Commissioner will retain management and maintenance responsibilities into the off-season until a new owner can be brought in to the league. Procedures and rules for off-season new member transfers are outlined in the following section. Any winnings granted to a team without an owner will be transferred to a discretionary fund for the league.</p></li>
<li><p>The Commissioner may be removed as the interim team manager if he is found to be in violation of the Constitution by a unanimous vote of the remaining league members. In this situation the league will then be required to vote by a 2/3 majority for another current team owner to serve as the interim manager of the vacated team until a new team owner can be presented and approved.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="off-season-transfers" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2</span> Off-Season Transfers</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The rules and regulations outlined in the previous section will apply to off-season team ownership transfers as well, with the exception of the omission of subsections g through k. Because of the timing of an off-season ownership transfer, there are several procedural differences that are not addressed in the previous section.</p></li>
<li><p>If a new owner is approved prior to the Keeper Deadline set out in <a href="#keeper-deadline">7.1.2</a> and no Keepers have yet to be chosen for the vacated team, a new team owner will accept the team in the condition that it was vacated in, including any additions and/or deletions made by the Commissioner in the interim period.</p></li>
<li>If a new owner is approved after the Keeper Deadline or if Keepers have been chosen before the team is vacated, that team will revert back to its status immediately following the end of the fantasy season, effectively making any and all Keeper decisions for the following fantasy season null and void. The new owner will have the option of making Keeper selections at the time of the transfer, even if the Keeper Deadline under <a href="#keeper-deadline">7.1.2</a> has passed.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>A new team owner may choose not to select any Keepers and begin the following fantasy season with all available player slots empty. Owners will otherwise be bound to the statutes outlined in the Constitution.</li>
<li>Should a team remain vacated by the date of the Keeper Deadline, the Commissioner, acting as the temporary team manager, will not make any Keeper selections for that team in anticipation of a new owner being selected by the league.</li>
<li>The Commissioner will also be prohibited from agreeing to any trades during this time frame involving Keepers and draft picks while acting as the temporary team manager.</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Draft Value for Keepers</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Any player selected by an owner as a Keeper for the following year will represent one draft pick in that year’s upcoming draft for that owner.</p></li>
<li>The draft value of that player is determined by several factors:
<ul>
<li>If the proposed Keeper has been owned by the team for the entirety of the season, the draft value of that player will be one round higher than that of the previous year.</li>
<li>If the proposed Keeper was acquired through a trade of any kind with another owner during the season and satisfies the Active Player Rule, the draft value of that player will be one round higher than that of the previous year, excepting those players under the Revalued Player Rule discussed in <a href="#the-revalued-player-rule">7.2.2</a> below.</li>
<li>If the proposed Keeper was acquired through free agency and satisfies the Active Player Rule and does not conflict with the Revalued Player Rule, the draft value of that player will be a 10th Round pick.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>If a team owner decides to keep 2 or more players with the same draft value for that year’s upcoming draft, the owner will designate one of the players to retain that value. Each of the other players will then be valued 1 consecutive round higher.</p></li>
<li><p>No team owner will be allowed to keep 2 or more players with 1st Round values for that year’s upcoming draft.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="the-revalued-player-rule" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.2</span> The Revalued Player Rule</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>All players remaining undrafted at the conclusion of the draft will be considered free agents and are eligible to be added to any team by the rules and regulations outlined in <a href="#waiver-wire-acquisitions">Article 5 (Waiver Wire Acquisitions)</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Any player chosen from free agency following the draft will constitute a 10th Round draft value if kept for the next fantasy season as outlined in <a href="#draft-value-for-keepers">7.2.1.2</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Players that have been drafted to a team and then subsequently dropped from that team become free agents per the rules outlined in <a href="#definition-of-waivers">5.0.1.4</a>.</p></li>
<li>The Revalued Player Rule states that any player drafted in rounds 2 through 16 who becomes a free agent during the fantasy football season will have their draft value reduced to the base level of 10th Round as outlined in <a href="#draft-value-for-keepers">7.2.1.2</a>, so long as that player remains a free agent for more than 2 weeks.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li>If the player is added to a team by an owner through free agency and that player has not remained in free agency for more than 2 weeks, the player will retain the draft value he had before being cut from the former team.
<ul>
<li>Example 1: Player A was taken in the 3rd Round of the draft. Player A was cut from that team 4 weeks into the fantasy season. Player A is then added 1 week later by another team owner. Should the new owner decide to make Player A his or her Keeper for the next season, Player A will command a 2nd Round draft value.</li>
<li>Example 2: Player A was taken in the 5th Round of the draft. Player A was cut from that team 4 weeks into the fantasy season. Player A is then added 3 weeks later by another team owner. Should the new owner decide to make Player A his or her Keeper for the next season, Player A will command a 10th Round draft value.</li>
<li>Example 3: Player A was taken in the 15th Round of the draft. Player A was cut from that team 4 weeks into the fantasy season. Player A is then added 1 week later by another team owner. Should the new owner decide to make Player A his or her Keeper for the next season, Player A will command a 14th Round draft value.</li>
<li>Example 4: Player A was taken in the 15th Round of the draft. Player A was cut from that team 4 weeks into the fantasy season. Player A is then added 3 weeks later by another team owner. Should the new owner decide to make Player A his or her Keeper for the next season, Player A will command a 10th Round draft value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The only exception to the Revalued Player Rule is as follows: If an owner drops a drafted player from his or her team and then chooses to re-add that same player, and no other owner has added that player in the interim, that player must remain a free agent for more than 3 weeks, not 2 under the normal rule, to have his draft value reduced to 13th Round for the original owner.
<ul>
<li>Example 5: Player A was taken in the 3rd Round of the draft. Player A was cut from that team 4 weeks into the fantasy season. Player A remains in free agency and is then added back to the original team 2 weeks later. Should the team owner decide to make Player A his or her Keeper for the next season, Player A will command a 2nd Round draft value.</li>
<li>Example 6: Player A was taken in the 5th Round of the draft. Player A was cut from that team 4 weeks into the fantasy season. Player A remains in free agency and is then added back to the original team 4 weeks later. Should the team owner decide to make Player A his or her Keeper for the next season, Player A will command a 10th Round draft value.</li>

<li><p>All owners will be expected to maintain an active roster at all times during the fantasy football season, including the playoffs, to the best of their ability.</p></li>
<li><p>An active roster is defined by a full starting lineup each week of active and eligible players.</p></li>
<li><p>If a team owner does not maintain an active roster for more than 3 weeks, he or she will be subject to penalization by the Commissioner outlined in <a href="#league-violations-and-penalties">1.1.3</a>.</p></li>
<li>There are some situations that may warrant violating this rule which is why a 3 week inactive roster period is allowed:
<ul>
<li>An owner might have all of one player type on a bye and, rather than dropping a desired player from his or her team, will simply not start a player at that position.</li>
<li>An owner may have a player become injured prior to the start of that particular game and might not have time to insert a new player.</li>
<li>An owner might be incapable of logging in to the host site to make lineup changes prior to the start of a scheduled game.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In the event of a vacated team, the Commissioner will assume responsibility of that team until a new owner can be approved per <a href="#mid-season-transfers">2.2.1</a> and will be subject to the same rules in this section for that team as well as his or her own team.</p></li>
